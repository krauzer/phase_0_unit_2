# U2.W4: Calculate the mode!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
	#Input: array of numbers (floats, integers) or strings. 
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
	#Output: array of number/s consisting of the most frequent elements in the input array
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
	#INIT a new hash, uniques, that is empty
	#INIT a new empty array, mode_vals, to be returned
	#ITERATE over inputed array and add element as key, occurences as value
	#PUSH keys with highest values into mode_vals array
	#RETURN mode_vals

# 2. Initial Solution




# 3. Refactored Solution



# 4. Reflection

	I've rethought my pseudocoding strategy because the page gets less readable with so many comments. Also, I think DBC wants us to commit at 
	each stage, so I shouldn't do all of them at the same time.
