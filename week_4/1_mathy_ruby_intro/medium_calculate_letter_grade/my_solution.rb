# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
#Input: an array of number grades
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
#Output: a string representing the letter value for the average of inputed grades
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
#DEFINE method, get_grade
#SET variable, average, to sum of array elements divided by length of array
#SET switch statement to convert average from a number to equivalent letter grade
#RETURN average
